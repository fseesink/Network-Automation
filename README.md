# Network Automation

This repo is simply a collection of information I have put together for my own use, sanitized/adjusted as needed to protect the guilty, and comes with the usual "if you break it, you get to keep both pieces" policy. :-)  But hopefully something in here may be of use to others as well.  Constructive feedback is always welcome.

Note I have organized information into directories according to the tool used.
